ANON_0 wanted information on how to get an email account and other digital privileges for a new employee. I have attached the form. The form can also be found at I:\TempWork\Austin
ANON_1 ANON_2 As you may or may not know, we are going to take Carleton's annual report on giving--Elements--online. As such, the proofing and editing aspect of the donor recognition lists also is going to happen via the web. We need to have an email account set up that will be used only for requesting and tracking edits/changes. (This is different from the email account that we have for our external audience - elements@carleton.edu - which I believe forward to a couple of us.) This new account would not be forward; a limited number of people will have access. Here's a suggestion: name: elementslists@carleton.edu pass: givingtocarleton Would like to have this up and running in a week. Let me know the status. ANON_3 ANON_4 ANON_4 ANON_5 Associate Director of Stewardship Carleton College 507-222-7590 mamundso@carleton.edu
When ANON_6 left the college, ANON_7 ANON_8 made arrangements for Bruce's email that do not fit well with existing provisioning policy and processing. Now that Bruce's position termination has actually come through, I would like to normalize those arrangements so that other things (such as library access) are working correctly.
The patron database for III Millennium grows as faculty and staff who have left the college remain in the database, and thus have library borrowing privileges even though they no longer work here. The same holds true for students who graduated in 2008 and 2009.
Please create an email resource address for the Info Desk at Sayles-Hill. My preference is infodesk@carleton.edu. Recipients to start will be jburmesc, mamy, mholling, nponder. Any questions, please contact me. Thank you, ANON_9 ANON_9 H. Burmesch Director of Campus Services Carleton College 507.222.5428 http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/services/
Please provide our TRIO Counselor Sarita Winterrowd-Lundin Datatel access on her computer in room #203 at TRIO, so she can access student transcripts and degree audits this year.

The document formally known as Elements is becoming Carleton's online Annual Report on Giving. As such the email we used for sending comments, suggestions, and corrections (elements@carleton.edu) is no longer appropriate. Please set up an email account with the following address: givingreport@carleton.edu Please forward emails from this address to the following: mamundso@carleton.edu sschulz@carleton.edu Please let me know when this has been set up.

ANON_23 ANON_29 was hired in development and starts today. She was just entered into Colleague this morning and so isn't in the account list yet, but needs her account as soon as possible. Please manually create the account for her.
In the frey on Wednesday, I didn't follow up to find the account setup code information. I haven't seen that stuff in months & didn't know where to look. (Is there a link on the sysnet page? .. I didn't have a chance to dig into it.) Anyway, he needs an account setup code again. He can be reached at x7107 (Sorry for making myself the client.. didn't know what to do with someone not yet provisioned.)

Trying to set up a new staff member with an account. Unable to change the password. Whatever I set it to it's rejecting when she types it in to change the password. I can't see anything wrong with how the account is set up. Am I missing something? Username is ksommers
Trying to set up another new employee account (snichols); when I change the password it fails to let her log in with it, but the incorrect login count does increment.

Hi, 1. ANON_138 ANON_139 is retiring on September 16. ANON_140 ANON_141 will be her 12 month temporary replacement. So effective that date Inara will need Evelyn's computer. She will also need access to all of the files on Evie's I drive and have access to the Registrar's shared drives. 2. To complicate that matter though... ANON_140 is going to start on August 22 because ANON_142 ANON_143 will be leaving our office as of August 26. Inara will need to use Cindy's computer until she takes over Evie's on September 16. We hope to have a temporary person in Cindy's position on September 12. 3. My (Ann's) computer screen has been a bit flaky. Would it be possible to get my new one before I get my new computer? 4. Even though ANON_142 ANON_143 is starting her new position on August 29, she will come back to our office that morning to do the last NSC transmission. So after Monday August 29, she should no longer have Colleague, Advance or On-Base privileges, as well as her access to the Registrar's shared drive. 5. ANON_144 need to get Inara set up with Email, Colleague, Advance and On-base. She worked for us as a student worker for a couple of years so she is familiar with all of that.

We have two new people starting this month (maintenance manager & supervisor) and I would like to get ITS accounts assigned to them so I can start scheduling meetings, order business cards, etc.? The are: ANON_185 ANON_186 (Maintenance manager) starting Jan. 16 ANON_43 ANON_187 (Maintenance supervisor) starting Jan. 30
ANON_188 requested that we immediately sever electronic access to a newly-terminated employee: ANON_189 ANON_190 (klawson) I have scrambled the AD and Zimbra passwords and disabled both accounts. Passing to Les for further review.
ANON_154 graduated in the summer of 2011 and his account was converted to an alumni account (hanthom_2011). He has since been rehired as an admissions reader and (because he's being paid) now has a staff account 'mhantho'. He wanted to log into theHub to fetch some transcript data from his time as a student, and couldn't do so. When he went through the password recovery process for his alumni account, he ran into an odd error.
Her name is now ANON_191
I have a new hire for SAP. Her name is ANON_36 ANON_192 and I need to get accounts set up for her. She will also need to have access to some of our proxy accounts.

hello, sadly, this year's outstanding educational associate in cams, alexander cooney, has just had his last day. i don't believe he has any electronics assigned to him, other than the designated fifth-year imac in 139 weitz which, as fiona macneill and i have discussed, next year's fifth year will continue to use, but will you let me know if there are any electronics still in his name? will you also turn off his staff access to e-mail, net ID and other data systems? i've expired his onecard access assignments that i control in cbord, as well as expired his group memberships and removed him as an operator from our cams webcheckout checkout center, although it appears his directory status has yet to roll from staff to alumnus. all best, pdb ANON_199 ANON_200 Technical ANON_201 ANON_202 and Media Studies Video and Audio Technical Director, Weitz Center for Creativity Carleton College One North College Street Northfield, Minnesota 55057 pbernhardt@carleton.edu 507 222-5698 http://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/cams/productionoffice/

Hi! I need to request two new employees at SHAC be set up with claim codes for IT/email access. They meet with HR next week, so they're likely not in the system yet. That said, anything that can be done by IT and/or HR to expedite the claim process once they're in would be greatly appreciated-- we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re trying to get them set up as soon as possible so they can start the Medicat training and charting process (which requires them to have @carleton emails to access). Their names are ANON_401 ANON_402 and Annet Zhuravel‚Äö√Ñ√ÆI‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll be helping them with the claim process and will instruct them to choose <nkhosnevis> and <azhuravel> as their IDs, since those are needed by ANON_403 to set them up as providers.

We need 5 user accounts that will allow random people to log in and see the email/calendar platforms that we are assessing for migration. This logging in will take place during supervised times and these accounts will be removed after testing is complete. The user names might as well be: gtestuser1 gtestuser2 gtestuser3 gtestuser4 gtestuser5 If a first name is helpful then 'gmail' will work and give us the proper username if the last names are 'user{n}' The only thing these user accounts are doing/need permissions for is accessing the Google email/calendaring platform, so if 'guest access' provides enough permisssions then that would be fine as well.
We have a new staff member who'll be at SHAC on a very ad hoc basis. ANON_408 ANON_409 (Temporary On-Call ANON_177 ANON_410 has already met with HR and shows up on our staff page.

Below is the note I received from MDecker. The re-image ticket being referenced is WHD ticket # 71535. --------------------- I am not sure if there was any other communication from ANON_0 for account setup, aside from my re-imaging ticket, so I am sending this note to you about her new hire arriving Monday 11/1/16. Please review her most recent note in the ticket as it relates to general setup (Julie) and ANON_441 ANON_442 I see he has an account that is provisioned for ANON_50 ANON_443 but I doubt ANON_0 has received any confirmation/next steps.

ANON_159 ANON_444 starts at Carleton on December 12th. He should be set up like ANON_159 ANON_445 and we will tweak from there, if needed.

Hi! I need to request that our two new 1-year employees (PRAC Counselors) at SHAC be set up with claim codes for IT/email access. They haven't met with HR yet, so no worries about timing, just as soon as is convenient once they're in the system. New PRAC Counselors: ANON_463 ANON_464 (akoester) ANON_465 ANON_466 (jselmonvasser) Please let me know if I can answer any questions, and many thanks for your help! All the best, ANON_21
ANON_467 is our 5th year in TSG and will need rights for password changing and Bitlocker code lookups, among other things.
ANON_47 ANON_139 would like her account to be mejohnson instead of mjohnson2.
New employee: ANON_468 ANON_469 --- ANON_1 ANON_470 The below was sent to Mycah's personal email address over the weekend, per our normal protocol. She should be able to access it there. You can also just print this out, paying special attention to the account code, and move on from there.

ANON_1 ANON_472 Hopefully this is the right ticket type, though I'm guessing it isn't. Please extend my access to email for a month past my end date. Thank you, ANON_473
ANON_18 was calling on behalf of the new animal care supervisor, ANON_474 ANON_475 who is just starting and needs his account set up. I emailed her the corresponding claim code and web page to pass along to ANON_476 ANON_477
ANON_1 ANON_478 It doesn't look like your profile has been set up, I thought it was before you started.... odd. I am cc: ANON_337 ANON_338 and the ITS helpdesk. Please respond to this email with a phone extension where you can be reached, that way ANON_337 or the helpdesk can call you.

ANON_36 was calling on behalf of a new Bon Apetit employee ANON_31 ANON_513 He specifically needed credentials to sign in to a machine. I was able to find the account claiming code and sent ANON_36 the relevant information (see tech note).

ANON_270 called in to report that he was having an error (not specified) going through the account claiming process. I said we would take a look at it and update him. He is a 2002 grad, so maybe that has complicated his account setup. He also requested that the email we contact him at be changed to matthew.j.stangl@gmail.com He can also be reached at 773 627 3403
Set up a new email for campus services. They are setting up new software for print services and if people are having trouble, wants them to be able to email a separate email address. Different from the general print services email, so problems with it can be dealt with individually.
