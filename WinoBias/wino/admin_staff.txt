Linda wanted information on how to get an email account and other digital privileges for a new employee.  I have attached the form.  The form can also be found at I:\TempWork\Austin
Hi Austin,  As you may or may not know, we are going to take Carleton's annual report on giving--Elements--online. As such, the proofing and editing aspect of the donor recognition lists also is going to happen via the web. We need to have an email account set up that will be used only for requesting and tracking edits/changes. (This is different from the email account that we have for our external audience - elements@carleton.edu - which I believe forward to a couple of us.) This new account would not be forward; a limited number of people will have access. Here's a suggestion:  name: elementslists@carleton.edu pass: givingtocarleton  Would like to have this up and running in a week. Let me know the status.  Thanks,  Marin  Marin Amundson-Graham Associate Director of Stewardship Carleton College 507-222-7590 mamundso@carleton.edu
When Bruce left the college, Sue Traxler made arrangements for Bruce's email that do not fit well with existing provisioning policy and processing.  Now that Bruce's position termination has actually come through, I would like to normalize those arrangements so that other things (such as library access) are working correctly.
The patron database for III Millennium grows as faculty and staff who have left the college remain in the database, and thus have library borrowing privileges even though they no longer work here.  The same holds true for students who graduated in 2008 and 2009.
Please create an email resource address for the Info Desk at Sayles-Hill. My preference is infodesk@carleton.edu.    Recipients to start will be jburmesc, mamy, mholling, nponder. Any questions, please contact me.    Thank you,   Julia       Julia H. Burmesch  Director of Campus Services  Carleton College  507.222.5428  http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/services/
Please provide our TRIO Counselor Sarita Winterrowd-Lundin Datatel access on her computer in room #203 at TRIO, so she can access student transcripts and degree audits this year.

Lori Hatfield x5512 to confirm setup/password Needs to be forwarded to  BonAppetit account (lori.hatfield@cafebonappetit.com)
The document formally known as Elements is becoming Carleton's online Annual Report on Giving. As such the email we used for sending comments, suggestions, and corrections (elements@carleton.edu) is no longer appropriate.  Please set up an email account with the following address:  givingreport@carleton.edu  Please forward emails from this address to the following:  mamundso@carleton.edu sschulz@carleton.edu  Please let me know when this has been set up. I'd like to test it before we put it into our announcement postcard.  Thanks,  Marin  Marin Amundson-Graham Associate Director of Stewardship Carleton College 507-222-7590 mamundso@carleton.edu
1. a filter was created in the wellness account for sherri, natalee and maria to have emails forwareded to them from wellness. We also needed the emails to stay in the account. we had to add keep in mailbox to the filter.  Wellness Staff calenders are  now being shared witht he wellness account.
Emily needs access to Colleague, Onbase and Reason. Sara said to see if Tammy had received the necessary forms.
Russ told me to make this ticket for David Tillary. I have the Account Setup Form in my hand and will set it on David's desk behind RR land.   This acount is for : Stefanie Kelly. Mari Aylin is her supervisor.  Jim Pence
He's thinking this should be local for when he sends emails to faculty/staff/students on campus. presidential search@carleton.edu. He would like the email to come from this address instead of his. A persona should work too.  Should this be a resource or a forward and add the names of the people that will be reading the replies.
Stefanie Kelly was hired in development and starts today.  She was just entered into Colleague this morning and so isn't in the account list yet, but needs her account as soon as possible.  Please manually create the account for her.
In the frey on Wednesday, I didn't follow up to find the account setup code information. I haven't seen that stuff in months & didn't know where to look. (Is there a link on the sysnet page? .. I didn't have a chance to dig into it.)   Anyway, he needs an account setup code again.  He can be reached at x7107   (Sorry for making myself the client.. didn't know what to do with someone not yet provisioned.)
could you please set this up for me?
Gloria wants to know what the username/e-mail of new staff member John Mathews will be.  There's already a Joy Mathews in the directory who doesn't appear to have a carleton.edu e-mail.
Trying to set up a new staff member with an account.  Unable to change the password.  Whatever I set it to it's rejecting when she types it in to change the password.  I can't see anything wrong with how the account is set up.  Am I missing something?  Username is ksommers
Trying to set up another new employee account (snichols); when I change the password it fails to let her log in with it, but the incorrect login count does increment.
Nathaniel called yesterday to inquire about his account/email setup and password.

Hi,     1.       Evelyn Johnson is retiring on September 16.  Inara Makhmudova will be her 12 month temporary replacement.  So effective that date Inara will need Evelyn's computer.  She will also need access to all of the files on Evie's I drive and have access to the Registrar's shared drives.  2.      To complicate that matter though... Inara is going to start on August 22 because Cindy Plash will be leaving our office as of August 26. Inara will need to use Cindy's computer until she takes over Evie's on September 16.  We hope to have a temporary person in Cindy's position on September 12.  3.      My (Ann's) computer screen has been a bit flaky.  Would it be possible to get my new one before I get my new computer?  4.      Even though Cindy Plash is starting her new position on August 29, she will come back to our office that morning to do the last NSC transmission.  So after Monday August 29, she should no longer have Colleague, Advance or On-Base privileges, as well as her access to the Registrar's shared drive.    5.      We'll need to get Inara set up with Email, Colleague, Advance and On-base.  She worked for us as a student worker for a couple of years so she is familiar with all of that.

Granted, the login and password he is currently using is old (associated with a staff member who no longer works here).  Also he has used Blackbaud as recently as last week.

We have a new employee who will start on November 7th, Dawn Fadden, Nurse Practitioner in SHAC.  Dawn has already completed paperwork at HR in order to get her into the Carleton system.  I know that it is not common practice for ITS to set a new employee up with a Carleton username and password before their first day, but because SHAC has many systems that require an email account (such as Medicat, our electronic health record), I would appreciate if Dawn could be put into the system in advance of her start date.   Thanks for your assistance,  Marit

Michael graduated in the summer of 2011 and his account was converted to an alumni account (hanthom_2011). He has since been rehired as an admissions reader and (because he's being paid) now has a staff account 'mhantho'. He wanted to log into theHub to fetch some transcript data from his time as a student, and couldn't do so. When he went through the password recovery process for his alumni account, he ran into an odd error.

hello,  sadly, this year's outstanding educational associate in cams, alexander cooney, has just had his last day. i don't believe he has any electronics assigned to him, other than the designated fifth-year imac in 139 weitz which, as fiona macneill and i have discussed, next year's fifth year will continue to use, but will you let me know if there are any electronics still in his name?  will you also turn off his staff access to e-mail, net ID and other data systems? i've expired his onecard access assignments that i control in cbord, as well as expired his group memberships and removed him as an operator from our cams webcheckout checkout center, although it appears his directory status has yet to roll from staff to alumnus.  all best, pdb   Paul Bernhardt Technical Director, Cinema and Media Studies Video and Audio Technical Director, Weitz Center for Creativity Carleton College One North College Street Northfield, Minnesota 55057 pbernhardt@carleton.edu 507 222-5698 http://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/cams/productionoffice/

Wanita will need access to I:\Departments\BUSO  Wanita will need the Panini configured to recognize her machine profile.  The Panini supports our remote deposit capabilities with Wells Fargo.  Wanita will need to be configured to print to all of the printers in the Business Office including the AP Printer which includes signture technology.  We have only four days for Wanita to cross-train with Emma.

Hi!  I need to request two new employees at SHAC be set up with claim codes for IT/email access.  They meet with HR next week, so they're likely not in the system yet. That said, anything that can be done by IT and/or HR to expedite the claim process once they're in would be greatly appreciated-- we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re trying to get them set up as soon as possible so they can start the Medicat training and charting process (which requires them to have @carleton emails to access). Their names are Nakisa Khosnevis and Annet Zhuravel‚Äö√Ñ√ÆI‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll be helping them with the claim process and will instruct them to choose <nkhosnevis> and <azhuravel> as their IDs, since those are needed by Medicat to set them up as providers. Please let me know if I can answer any questions, and many thanks for your help! All my best, David

We need 5 user accounts that will allow random people to log in and see the email/calendar platforms that we are assessing for migration. This logging in will take place during supervised times and these accounts will be removed after testing is complete.  The user names might as well be:  gtestuser1 gtestuser2 gtestuser3 gtestuser4 gtestuser5  If a first name is helpful then 'gmail' will work and give us the proper username if the last names are 'user{n}'  The only thing these user accounts are doing/need permissions for is accessing the Google email/calendaring platform, so if 'guest access' provides enough permisssions then that would be fine as well.
We have a new staff member who'll be at SHAC on a very ad hoc basis.  Pamela Tietz (Temporary On-Call Nurse Practitioner) has already met with HR and shows up on our staff page.  I need to request that she be set up with claim codes for IT/email access, and that her claim codes be copied to me as well. Thanks! 
Aaron's assistant coach, who has been on campus since Fall Term, has yet to receive a Carleton Account for email, hub access, etc.  The assistant's name is Mick Williams.  Can we set up an account and claim for Mick Williams as soon as possible? He would like to update critical information in the hub.
Hi Les,  We have a new business manager starting Monday at SERC. Her name is Amy Collette and she is Karen Smetana's replacement. Can you arrange for Amy to have the same collab access that Karen had?  Thank you very much, Erica

Adam Berliner decided not to continue on the IACUC committee  and we now have a new community member to take his spot.  Her name is Emily Kraus and her email address is krausemily58@gmail.com.  Would you please set her up with a username and password so that she can receive the IACUC protocols that are submitted?  Adam was adam_iacuc.  I would be happy to delete Adam and add Emily to the IACUC Committee Group in Reason once you are done.  She will be starting the week of the 19th, so it would be helpful if we could have her set up by then.
Alyse has a new last name. She has changed her account name in Advance and started the process at HR.   Original last name = Eggebrecht  New last name = Simondet  
Elisabeth left me a voice mail.  She has a new staff member starting in early October and wanted to make sure there were no additional IT forms she needed to be filling out.
Hi! Just found out the we're being joined by a new, part-time staff member starting this Thursday, Sept. 29.

Anything that can be done to expedite the process would be great, many thanks! All the best, David 
Below is the note I received from MDecker. The re-image ticket being referenced is WHD ticket # 71535. --------------------- I am not sure if there was any other communication from Linda for account setup, aside from my re-imaging ticket, so I am sending this note to you about her new hire arriving Monday 11/1/16. Please review her most recent note in the ticket as it relates to general setup (Julie) and OnBase (Russ). I see he has an account that is provisioned for Karl Symons, but I doubt Linda has received any confirmation/next steps. Who else needs to know about this new hire for access related things? Les is out, correct? 
Tom Brice starts at Carleton on December 12th.  He should be set up like Tom Feiler, and we will tweak from there, if needed.

Katie was calling on behalf of a new Bon Apetit employee John Olson. He specifically needed credentials to sign in to a machine.  I was able to find the account claiming code and sent Katie the relevant information (see tech note).
It will need access to the following directory: \\protected.ads.carleton.edu\protected\Departments\ITS\ITS-Only\SSIS-Projects\Tk20\Data

Since Les is out of the office until 1/2/19, can someone look into this and let me know if these folks have Carleton credentials yet? If they don't, is there someone who can get their credentials set up so they can begin reading files on Monday, Dec. 31st which is their first day of employment.  ---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Dan Taylor <dtaylor@carleton.edu> Date: Thu, Dec 27, 2018 at 12:15 PM Subject: Re: PT Readers To: Linda Mueller <lmueller@carleton.edu>   Linda,  I have received paperwork from everyone except Dylan Welch.

Lisa reported that two new hires, csmith3 and ealtermatt, can't see the SERC department's team folder in Dropbox. They just started today, so its entirely possible that the process just hasn't finished yet and they will be granted access tomorrow.

Good Morning,  I was hoping someone could assist me with sending out a Carleton account setup email to a new employee starting Monday, June 10? The employees name is Paula Teiken (2020786).  It is my understanding that Les LaCroix is out of the office until Monday so I was hoping another individual could send the email and let me know if/when it is sent so I can contact the new employee and let them know.  Let me know if you need any more information.  Thanks,  --  Dan Taylor Human Resources Assistant Carleton College 507-222-6832

In any case, you had asked if he wanted a specific user name. His name over at St. Olaf is 'rye2'. If that is available, he'll take it. As you said you'd take a stab at getting him in the right groups. That should work for starters. We can sort out any details as we discover them.  Thanks,  Kendall George

Matt called in to report that he was having an error (not specified) going through the account claiming process.  I said we would take a look at it and update him.  He is a 2002 grad, so maybe that has complicated his account setup.  He also requested that the email we contact him at be changed to matthew.j.stangl@gmail.com  He can also be reached at 773 627 3403
Set up a new email for campus services.   They are setting up new software for print services and if people are having trouble, wants them to be able to email a separate email address.   Different from the general print services email, so problems with it can be dealt with individually. 
Sue Newland was supposed to receive an email from Les Lacroix so that she could set up her account, but has not received the email yet, and would like to have it resent.
